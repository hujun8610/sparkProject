AFL chief Gillon McLachlan said the banner was "divisive, ignorant and deeply offensive".
Collingwood president and TV host Eddie McGuire said he was "sick to death" of people using the sport to promote "vile hatred".

Last year, Mr Goodes took time out of the game after being repeatedly booed, which he said was racially motivated.
Muslims make up about 2% of Australia's population.
Last November, a survey suggested that Australian Muslims experienced three times the average amount of racism faced by other ethnic groups.
